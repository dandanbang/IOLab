<!--
1. User sees labeled ‘to-do’ and ‘completed items’ lists, which are empty upon page load. The lists are visually distinct from each other.
2. User can add one ‘to-do’ item at a time using a text input field and an ‘add to list’ button.
3. Each newly-added ‘to-do’ item appears at the top of the ‘to-do’ list (not the bottom).
4. User can click a button within each ‘to-do’ item to mark it as complete, at which point:
a. The ‘to-do’ item disappears from the ‘to-do’ list
b. The ‘to-do’ item appears at the top of the ‘completed items’ list.
c. Items on the ‘completed items’ list should be styled differently than those on the ‘to-do’ list as an additional visual indication of their completion.
5. User can click a button within each ‘complete’ item to ‘unmark’ it as complete, at which point:
a. The ‘complete’ item disappears from the ‘completed items’ list.
b. The ‘complete’ item appears at the top of the ‘to-do’ list with the same styling as the other ‘to-do’ list items.
6. Items on each list remain there until the user marks or ‘unmarks’ them.
7. Your site has a title and intuitive labeling or instructions on how to use it.
8. You can use only jQuery and JavaScript – no additional plugins/libraries.
9. Your JS and CSS code is separate from your HTML (i.e., there should be no inline CSS styling or JavaScript within your HTML file).
10. All of your JavaScript is commented appropriately.
11. Your code is clean and concise (minimal repetition and unused code)-->
